# About Me

I'm a young student, programmer and nerd from Finland who spends most of their time doing all kinds of cool stuff with computers.
My interests range from type theory to embedded development and from functional programming to radio technology.

- I mostly work with Rust and Nix

## Studies

- Master's student in Computer Science @ Aalto University
- Bachelor's student in Mathematics @ University of Helsinki

## Teaching

- [CS-C2170 Programming Languages](https://fitech101.aalto.fi/en/courses/modern-and-emerging-programming-languages) @ Aalto University
- [Programming in Rust](https://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/teaching/nprg082/) @ Charles University

## Volunteering

- Chair & founding member @ [OtaNix ry](https://otanix.fi)
- Head of Digital Services @ [Tietokilta ry](https://tietokilta.fi)
- Board member @ [Testausserveri ry](https://testausserveri.fi)

## ThinkPads

I'm an enthusiastic ThinkPad owner and until recently, I was daily driving a T480. Nowadays I have a Framework Laptop 13 AMD.

I have previously used the following machines:

* [X200](/blog/x200.html)
* [T440p](/blog/t440p.html)
* W540
* T450s
* T480

## Programming

I spend a big part of my time programming. I'm most experienced with Rust, C/C++, Nix, Scala and Haskell.
My experience ranges from full-stack development to embedded development.

Here are some of my notable projects:

* [Testaustime](https://testaustime.fi): Tracks the users coding activity and allows them to analyze their data and compete with other users.
    All source code is freely available here.
* [Torimies](https://github.com/Testausserveri/torimies-rs): A Discord and Telegram bot written in Rust, that sends updates on Tori.fi
    and huuto.net listings based on filter provided by the user.
    It utilizes the Tori.fi API which I had to reverse-engineer in order to get this working.
* [Laskugeneraattori](https://github.com/Tietokilta/laskugeneraattori): An invoice generator built with Rust based on Axum and Typst

Additionally I've made contributions to large open-source projects such as Transmission.

## Linux

I've been using Linux-based system almost exclusively since 2019. Nowadays, most of my systems are based on [NixOS](https://nixos.org). The configuration for my systems is publicly available [here](https://github.com/lajp/nix).

## Contacts

To get in touch with me, please use email.
It is generally the best and most reliable way to reach me.
An alternative way of reaching me is through Discord where my username is `lajp.`
