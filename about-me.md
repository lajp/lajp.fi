# About Me

I'm a young student, programmer, and nerd from Finland who spends most of their time doing all kinds of cool stuff with computers.
My interests range from pure math to embedded development and from functional programming to radio technology.
Currently I am working with Rust, Nix and Scala.

I study computer science at Aalto University where I'm currently halfway through my BSc degree.
I'm also a student at Helsinki University where I study mathematics.

I'm an active and respected member in the [Testausserveri ry](https://testausserveri.fi) community for young Finnish hackers

## ThinkPads

I'm currently daily driving a T480

I have previously used the following machines:

* [X200](/blog/x200.html)
* [T440p](/blog/t440p.html)
* W540
* T450s
* T480

## Programming

I spend a big part of my time programming. I'm most experienced with Rust, C/C++, Scala and Haskell.
My experience ranges from full-stack development to embedded development.

Here are some of my notable projects:

* [Testaustime](https://testaustime.fi): Tracks the users coding activity and allows them to analyze their data and compete with other users.
    All source code is freely available here.
* [Torimies](https://github.com/Testausserveri/torimies-rs): A Discord and Telegram bot written in Rust, that sends updates on Tori.fi
    and huuto.net listings based on filter provided by the user.
    It utilizes the Tori.fi API which I had to reverse-engineer in order to get this working.
* [blmgr](https://github.com/lajp/blmgr): A simple, yet powerful backlight/brightness manager for Linux with a small and easily hackable codebase.

Additionally I've made contributions to large open-source projects such as Transmission.

## Linux

I've been using Linux-based system almost exclusively since 2019.

I maintain my own email server based on postfix and dovecot.

## Contacts

To get in touch with me, please use email.
It is generally the best and most reliable way to reach me.
An alternative way of reaching me is through Discord where my username is `lajp.`
